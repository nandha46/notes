The protagonist's loyalty to the Zamindar is solely rooted in his affection for the Zamindar's daughter, yet he paradoxically imparts a powerful message about resistance to the British colonial rule to the villagers.

Our film industry's penchant for musical interludes proves to be a drawback in this movie. While life must continue even in the face of slavery and suffering, the film fails to convincingly depict this harsh reality, rendering the inclusion of songs gratuitous.

Pugazh's performance is commendable.",torrent,2023-10-21
